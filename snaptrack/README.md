## Privacy

SnapTrack is built with privacy as a core principle:

- âœ… All data stored locally on your device
- âœ… No user accounts or registration required
- âœ… API keys stored securely
- âœ… No analytics or tracking
- âœ… No data sharing with third parties

The only external communication is with the OpenAI API for food analysis, and only when you explicitly request it.
